       anything shows. Three things fix it, and all three are needed:
         $EXTMIN/$EXTMAX  what ZOOM EXTENTS uses, and what a viewer reads to
                          frame a preview
         $LIMMIN/$LIMMAX  what ZOOM ALL uses — it frames LIMITS union the
                          extents, so stale default limits (an A3 sheet at the
                          origin) are exactly what parks the drawing in a
