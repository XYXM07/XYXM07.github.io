/* nasjidwg — page packing for the AC1018..AC1032 container.
 *
 * Pages in these releases are stored in a byte-oriented LZ77 dialect. The
 * packed form is a chain of opcodes that alternate between two things: a
 * run of raw bytes, and a back-reference into the output produced so far.
 * The alternation is implicit rather than flagged — every back-reference
 * carries, in its own low two bits, the length of the literal run that
 * follows it. Opcode 0x11 ends the stream.
 *
 * Counts share one escape convention. A count that does not fit its field
 * stores zero there and continues outside the opcode as a chain of 0x00
 * bytes worth 0xFF apiece, closed by a non-zero byte.
 */
